# Context Sensitive Analysis
* This stage checks high-level language requirements that go **beyond syntax**
* Context matters in this case, so the rules cannot be enforced by a **Context Free Grammar** 
* We could use **Context Sensitive Grammar**, or traverse the parse tree (**Concrete Syntax Tree**) and use code to enforce context-sensitive rules 
* Concreate Syntax Tree is often transformed into **Abstract Syntax Tree** before doing context sensitive analyses.
